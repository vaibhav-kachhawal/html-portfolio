<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a Final Year Student at VIT Vellore, pursuing a degree in Information Technology. As a keen enthusiast of computers and
technology, I am particularly passionate about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I consider myself a dedicated learner
with strong leadership qualities, along with the confidence and courage to network with a wide range of people. While still in the
early stages of my technical studies, I have prior management experience and handle responsibilities effectively. Additionally, I am
passionate about dancing and traveling, and I enjoy participating in various sports, including cricket, badminton, basketball, and
swimming. I am a quick learner who easily develops new interests and continually seeks to explore new horizons.</p>
